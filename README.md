## How to use GIT

Those are the steps you need to follow every time you code.

   - 1st Update others' changes: 
    
    git pull

   - (in case you changed something before pulling do this but it will delete what you have done after last push and before pulling:)

    git pull --rebase origin main

   - 2nd Coding

   - 3rd Add the files to the repo:

    git add .

   - 4th Commit:

    git commit -m "your personal comment"

   - fth Updating with your changes:

    git push

## Code structure

It is decided that each step will have its own code file. One python file for step of the assignment. Then import-export results if needed.

Do not create more branches, just change, if you are not sure create a copy of the file in the repo indicating the version _v2 version 2. _v3 version 3...
You can even add your name in the name of the file.

Victor will update the data.

Name the files like Step_n_vn .So, Step_number of step_version
